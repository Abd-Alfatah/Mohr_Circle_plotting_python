# Mohr_Circle_plotting_python
This a pyhton software that can be used to plot mohr circle*.
To plot the more circle you will need the stress-strain tensor of the material (A tensor is matrix with size 3*3).
# More info about Mohr circle
The transformation law for the Cauchy stress tensor is graphically represented as a circle in two dimensions by Mohr's circle.

Mohr's circle is frequently used in estimates for the strength of materials in mechanical engineering, the strength of soils in geotechnical engineering, and the strength of built structures in structural engineering. By breaking them down into their vertical and horizontal components, it is also utilized to calculate stresses in many other planes. Mohr's circle is one of the simplest methods for finding the principle planes and the principal stresses in a graphical representation. These are known as principal planes in which principal stresses are calculated.
